The Matlab version in use is R2023a, CVX version is 2.2.2, MOSEK version is 10.2.7, and Gurobi version is 12.0.0. All programs utilize MATLAB's built-in toolboxes.

Running Test_group_lasso.m with the random seed set to 24847563 (which has been set as the default seed) can reproduce the results reported. The final visualization in the report can be generated by running the plot_results section of Test_group_lasso.m.

When running locally, the gl_mosek.m and gl_gurobi.m scripts include a step to add paths. For submission, this step has been commented out.
